# TECH_DEBT_MVP

This file lists technical debt, cleanup tasks and product decisions that should be resolved for a first usable MVP/beta version of Reals.

MVP scope here means: enough to run the core product flow end-to-end with controlled users, a dev/staging backend, Android APK distribution, and known temporary shortcuts clearly documented.

Do not implement these implicitly while working on unrelated tasks.


## 5. MVP infrastructure/dev environment

### 5.1 First external dev deploy target

MVP need:
- A backend environment reachable from a physical Android device and installable APK.

Decision pending:
- Choose first external development deploy target.

Candidates:
- Render.
- Fly.io.
- Railway.
- Google Cloud Run.
- AWS App Runner.
- ECS Fargate.
- Managed PostgreSQL provider such as Neon, Supabase, Render PostgreSQL, Railway PostgreSQL or AWS RDS.

MVP recommendation:
- Prefer simple container platform + managed PostgreSQL before Kubernetes.

### 5.2 Dev deployment model

Before distributing APKs beyond local machine:
- Define runtime platform.
- Define managed PostgreSQL instance.
- Define Firebase service-account secret.
- Define environment variables.
- Define health check path.
- Define rollback strategy.
- Define which GHCR tag dev tracks.

### 5.3 Smoke check workflow

MVP task:
- Wire the manual `Smoke check` GitHub Actions workflow into the eventual dev deploy pipeline once the dev runtime platform exists.

Acceptance criteria:
- Smoke check runs against the deployed backend.
- `/actuator/health` and `/actuator/info` are aligned with deployed image metadata.

## 6. Explicitly deferred from MVP

The following are intentionally not MVP blockers:

- Real-time chat via WebSocket or SSE.
- Additional push notification event coverage beyond currently implemented MVP events.
- Google Sign-In / social auth providers.
- Reveal quotas.
- Advanced compatibility scoring.
- ML-based matching.
- Popularity, attractiveness or ELO-style ranking.
- Gamified reputation badges.
- Production trust score based on real behavior.
- Full manual moderation workflow.
- Identity verification provider integration.
- Canonical country/city reference dataset.
- Geohash/spatial indexing.
- CDN/cache strategy for media.
- Application-level message encryption.
- Parallel matchmaking workers.
- Kubernetes/Helm/Terraform unless the chosen platform requires them.

### 6.1 Push notification delivery workflow cleanup

Current notification event services intentionally keep their event-specific
behavior explicit, but they repeat the same delivery workflow:

- check existing `PushNotificationDelivery` by user, notification type and aggregate id;
- load active device tokens;
- send through `PushNotificationSender`;
- disable invalid tokens;
- save `SENT`, `FAILED` or `SKIPPED_NO_ACTIVE_TOKEN`;
- catch per-user failures without failing the owning product transition.

Planned cleanup:

- Extract a shared `PushNotificationDeliveryService` under `service.notification`.
- Keep event services responsible for eligibility, recipients and payload shape.
- Keep provider transport under `service.notification.sender`.
- Preserve existing idempotency semantics and delivery statuses.
- Avoid changing notification timing, scheduler cadence or payload contents during the extraction.
